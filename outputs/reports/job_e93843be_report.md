City of Dallas Hiring Team

Dear Hiring Team,

At Limecord, I built the AWS and Kubernetes foundation that let multiple client teams deploy safely without waiting for infrastructure approvals. I'd like to bring that same platform engineering approach to the City of Dallas.

Your Platform Engineer role aligns perfectly with my experience modernizing infrastructure for organizations with high reliability expectations. At Agora Data, I applied SRE principles to production systems during rapid growth—the kind of operational maturity that government services require. When I introduced GitOps workflows at AFG Technologies, we eliminated configuration drift and made every infrastructure change auditable by default.

What sets my approach apart is building platforms that enable developer autonomy while preserving operational control. At Supreme Golf, I established platform engineering as a formal discipline, creating paved paths that reduced infrastructure friction by 60% while actually improving security posture. The team could move faster because the guardrails were built in, not bolted on afterward.

I'm particularly drawn to this role because public sector infrastructure work demands the reliability and compliance rigor I've developed across SOC 2 environments. My AWS expertise spans the full stack—from landing zone design to Kubernetes orchestration—but always with operational readiness in mind.

The City of Dallas deserves infrastructure that just works. I'd welcome the chance to discuss how my platform engineering experience could support that mission. What questions can I answer about my background?

Sincerely,
Alex Korshak
```
