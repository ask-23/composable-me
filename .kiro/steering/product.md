# Product Overview

Composable Crew is a truth-constrained, multi-agent system for generating high-quality job applications. It's a personal job search tool designed for senior engineers and technical leaders.

## Core Value Proposition

The system solves the job application problem through specialized AI agents that:
- Never fabricate experience or alter chronology
- Generate human-sounding content that passes AI detection
- Tailor applications precisely to job requirements
- Surface unique differentiators rather than generic strengths

## Key Differentiators

1. **Truth-First Architecture** - All claims must trace to source documents (AGENTS.MD enforces immutable truth laws)
2. **Anti-AI Detection** - Built-in language patterns to avoid AI detection tools (STYLE_GUIDE.MD)
3. **Multi-Agent Orchestration** - Specialized agents with single responsibilities coordinated by Commander
4. **Human-in-the-Loop** - User greenlight required before proceeding with applications

## Target User

Senior+ engineers and technical leaders (DevOps, Platform, SRE, Architect, VP Engineering) who need to:
- Tailor applications without spending hours per role
- Maintain truthfulness while positioning experience effectively
- Avoid AI detection in application materials
- Find and articulate unique value propositions

## Workflow

1. User provides job description and resume
2. Commander analyzes fit and requests greenlight
3. Gap Analyzer maps requirements to experience
4. Interrogator-Prepper generates questions to fill gaps
5. Differentiator identifies unique positioning
6. Tailoring Agent creates resume + cover letter
7. Auditor Suite verifies truth, tone, and compliance

## Non-Negotiable Rules

- Chronology is sacred (no date changes, no reordering)
- No fabrication (no invented tools, metrics, or achievements)
- The Everest Rule: if you didn't do it, don't claim it
- Source authority: all claims must trace to verified documents
- Adjacent framing: transferable experience framed honestly, not as direct
