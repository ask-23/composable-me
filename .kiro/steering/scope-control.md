# Scope Control

<!-- 
TODO: Customize this file for your project.
Define what's in scope and what's out of scope for your MVP/current phase.
-->

## Current Phase

<!-- What phase is this project in? -->
[e.g., MVP, v1.0, Beta]

## In Scope

### Features
<!-- What features are we building? -->
- [ ] Feature 1
- [ ] Feature 2
- [ ] Feature 3

### User Types
<!-- Who are we building for? -->
- [User type 1]
- [User type 2]

### Platforms
<!-- What platforms do we support? -->
- [Platform 1]
- [Platform 2]

## Out of Scope (For Now)

### Deferred Features
<!-- Features we're NOT building yet -->
- ❌ [Deferred feature 1] - [Why deferred]
- ❌ [Deferred feature 2] - [Why deferred]

### Not Supported
<!-- Things we explicitly don't support -->
- ❌ [Not supported 1]
- ❌ [Not supported 2]

## Guardrails

### Technical Constraints
<!-- Technical limits we're enforcing -->
- [Constraint 1]
- [Constraint 2]

### UI Constraints
<!-- UI limits we're enforcing -->
- Maximum [N] fields per form
- Only use [allowed components]

### Process Constraints
<!-- Process limits we're enforcing -->
- No feature flags
- No A/B testing
- Deploy to staging before production

## Scope Creep Signals

Watch out for these patterns that indicate scope creep:

- ⚠️ "While we're at it, let's also..."
- ⚠️ "It would be nice if..."
- ⚠️ "Users might also want..."
- ⚠️ Adding edge cases before core is solid

## Decision Framework

When someone proposes new work:

1. **Is it in scope?** → If no, defer or reject
2. **Is it blocking launch?** → If no, defer
3. **Is it simple?** → If complex, defer or simplify
4. **Does it add value?** → If not clearly, defer

## Scope Change Process

To change scope:

1. Document the proposed change
2. Assess impact on timeline
3. Get explicit approval
4. Update this document
5. Update Linear/specs accordingly
