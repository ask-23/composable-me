# Stream A: Foundation Complete ✅

**Date:** 2024-12-05  
**Agent:** Kiro  
**Status:** Foundation Phase Complete

## What Was Built

### 1. Coordination System
- ✅ Created `.kiro/work-streams/` directory structure
- ✅ Created `assignments.json` - master list of all streams
- ✅ Created README.md - how the system works
- ✅ Set up status tracking for all streams

### 2. Agent Interface Specifications
- ✅ Defined input/output contracts for all 8 agents
- ✅ Specified YAML schemas
- ✅ Documented error handling patterns
- ✅ Created validation rules

**Location:** `stream-a-kiro/agent-interfaces.md`

### 3. Stream Assignments
Created detailed assignment files for each stream:
- ✅ Stream B (Claude) - Commander Agent
- ✅ Stream C (Codex) - Gap Analyzer
- ✅ Stream D (Augment) - Interrogator-Prepper
- ✅ Stream E (Assistant) - Differentiator & Tailoring
- ✅ Stream F (Assistant) - ATS Optimizer & Auditor

Each assignment includes:
- Mission statement
- Requirements references
- Interface contracts
- Dependencies
- Testing requirements
- Deliverables

### 4. Integration Framework Design
- ✅ Designed architecture
- ✅ Defined components (Workflow Runner, Agent Coordinator, etc.)
- ✅ Specified data flow
- ✅ Documented error handling strategy
- ✅ Created implementation roadmap

**Location:** `stream-a-kiro/integration-framework.md`

## What's Next

### Immediate (Blocking)
1. **Wait for Stream B (Commander)** - This is the critical path
2. **Wait for Stream C (Gap Analyzer)** - Also on critical path

### Once Agents Are Available
1. Implement integration framework skeleton
2. Create workflow runner
3. Implement schema validator
4. Integrate Commander agent
5. Test basic workflow
6. Integrate remaining agents as they complete

### Final Phase
1. End-to-end testing
2. Error handling refinement
3. Performance optimization
4. Documentation

## Deliverables

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `assignments.json` | Master stream list | ✅ Complete |
| `README.md` | How the system works | ✅ Complete |
| `agent-interfaces.md` | Interface specs | ✅ Complete |
| `integration-framework.md` | Integration design | ✅ Complete |
| `stream-b-claude/assigned.md` | Commander assignment | ✅ Complete |
| `stream-c-codex/assigned.md` | Gap Analyzer assignment | ✅ Complete |
| `stream-d-augment/assigned.md` | Interrogator assignment | ✅ Complete |
| `stream-e-assistant/assigned.md` | Differentiator/Tailoring assignment | ✅ Complete |
| `stream-f-assistant/assigned.md` | ATS/Auditor assignment | ✅ Complete |

## Blockers

**Current Blocker:** Waiting for other streams to start implementation.

Stream A cannot proceed with integration work until at least Stream B (Commander) begins.

## Success Criteria

Stream A foundation is successful if:
- ✅ All streams have clear assignments
- ✅ All interfaces are well-defined
- ✅ Integration strategy is documented
- ✅ Other streams can work independently
- ✅ Communication system is in place

**All criteria met!** ✅

## Notes

The foundation is solid. All other streams have everything they need to start work:
- Clear requirements
- Interface specifications
- Dependencies documented
- Testing requirements defined
- Communication channels established

The ball is now in the court of Streams B-F. Once they start delivering agents, Stream A will integrate and test.
